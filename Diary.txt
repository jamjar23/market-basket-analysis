Mid-Jan to mid-Feb
Perfect 14G report.
MILIS purchasing training.

Early Mar
Add Comment functionality to 14G.

6-Mar
Reviewed High/Low growth with Vannessa (but Luke had already processed most of them).
Discussed managing AIMS with Sean Clutterbuck (follow up in $0.01 stock code, high/low growth review and action, etc.) 
Changed 14G.xlsm to look at UsageALL (all managed stock codes) rather than just UsageREQS.
Refreshed UsageALL.
Note: UsageALL is based on Requesting district, whereas UsageREQS was based on Issuing District.
Ran list of NIINs with credits vs usage to review on AIMS and adjust history accordingly.

7-Mar
Updated 14G Datamart extracts and update routines. New UsageREQS just extracts latest YTD usage by Requesting District for NIINs with 14G Reqs.
Added 0 usage for 7008 for each year 2011-2017 so usage graphs will be forced to show every year (unless non-zero usage for 7008 was already recorded). 
Tried various methods to obtain Datamart usage data for RI Balanced Inventory Analysis (REQS and SMH). Added NetMAARS data for additional parts
 sent through by Ryan EF.

9-Mar
14G refresh. Modded 14G to run single macro to perform refresh. Fixed PM2 query/dataset (was >AL90 instead of <>AL90).  Discuss/develop top-level review 
approach for AIMS RFQ/PO checks (w Ando & Vannessa).  Brainstorm w/Ando re. better ways to plan shelf-life items  - standard logic applies except an adjustment 
should be applied based on quantity of stock expected to age out (usage vs life remaining).
Get data for/calculate CAF25 YTD budget.
Draft AIMS approval top-down sense check for review.

13-Mar

forecast receipts through end of May (end of COA year for payments). 
Investigate how to perform network analysis/graphing.

Afternoon, meeting with KK and JL on TLS pricing for RI/BDS/CAF25. Run 14G. Review army policy on min/max CST holdings with Luke and add number of issues CST Min/Max report.

4-Apr
Review of high-growth and low-growth with Luke.  Appears this exercise is mostly meaningless - is SKUL specific and is typical AIMS overkill, and requires much more analysis to fix than is worth it for most  SKULS (particularly since many or even most won't actually generate purchase recommendations in the near/medium future). Also suspect the same suspects may appear again next month as I think the review is simply picking up all SKULs where last year usage vs next year forecast is <50% or >100%. Recommend only focus on invesitgating/fixing high value  (>$1000 extended cost?) SKULs and leaving high level review by Ando to pick up and filter other anomalies.
Work on the ROT problem - why are so many IDTs hanging up as ROTs requiring manual intervention? Draw complete CAF25 165 file for review and clean up.

5-Apr
Work on usage data for A and M class items for Balanced Inventory review. Discuss LMAD rationalisation with Taps. Investigate apparent new stock codes appearing on PM.  Check ADFLM vs SIO (including build cross-ref table in DM_ASD_AL for future queries).  SIOs and ADFLMs match with one exception, sent to Max for correction.

recording.

19-Apr
Jed to Code Camp.  
Took a long time but succeeded in finding bug in could for applying median to AL/REQ type records and succeeded in adding this implementation.
Investigated Connections - functionality and implementation - to try to prevent users with 14G workbooks open from locking Supply.accdb to changes 
(Comment functionality establishes connection - added code to verify connection is ReadWrite [not more exclusive] and to close the connection after each 
comment is added).
Email Ian Clark re. Chem Alert info locatoin on DataMart.

20-Apr
Jed to Code Camp.  Write letter to Minister for Education re. Commonwealth Supported Places for graduate education.

Ian Clark response good, retrieve data for Chem ALert (NIIN/LMAD to ref-number) for Trevor Reed.
Update Min/Max stock for Luke, look into how to tell requesting Dist/WH (rather than issuing  Dist/WH). Can't, can only tell SCA, from which District can be 
inferred with some accuracy, but not WH. So for Min/Max purposes, can only show usage for issuing Dist/WH.
Update CAF25, and try to automate matching of SAP vs MILIS PO backlog.

24-Apr

Produce 170/210 non-PSU exception report for SIMs.

17-May-17
Resume Monthly ILS presentation. Problems linking Access queries to Excel/Powerpoint - revert to pasting results (Access>Excel>PP).  Resume Tranfer Process Time analysis (manula bar chart graph 
showing qty (width) and time (length, based on last Acquittal > Fully Rcvd).  Verify Acquittals and Fully Rcvd data using SMH (seems LA data is suspect - many instances where it is after FR date).
Warehouse Transfer sequence appears to be Issue (IS-IA) Receive (2S-2A) and Stock (RS-RA).  (Paired digits represent MT and MA, each action seems to involve a relieving action [S] and an acquiring action [A]).
Some WT skip the intermediate step (just IS-IA-RS-RA) > So for Acquittal we are looking for IS, for Rcvd we are looking for RS.
For End User Req, the full sequence is only IS-IA-RS.
IDTs lose the Req Info after being issued, so hard to track receipt at the other end!
Also found problems with IDTs - REQ showing 0 day TPT but SMH showing 2 days.... lots of data wrangling to determine true TPTs from SMH
Run PSU 170-210 review for SIMs.
Investigate use of CorrelationID and TaskID to link stock moves together (issue from one locatoin/time and receipt at another)

18-May-17
CAF25 risk analysis with Ando, review with JL/KK Megan
CorrelationID and TaskID don't seem to link stock moves together, other than the two halves of the simultaneous double entry (eg for transfers, relieve from from physical WH and place in virtual WH). The
corresponding transaction (eg for other end of the transfer, relieve from virtual WH, receive to physical WH) carries it's own CorrelationID and TaskID.

22-May-17
Apply to UWS. Download catalogue for updating (for Vannessa/new item review).  Run Shelf Life for Angelo.

1-June
Update 14G.. Found bug slowing down formatting macro (worksheet events required disabling while formatting) and also events were incorrectly causing comments to be duplicated in 14G comment 
table as if written by me with timestamp from the macro.  Caused duplication of (therefore increase in) rows in output sheet, disabling events while formatting also fixed this problem.

5-June
Modelling of CAF25 usage to develop updated forecast and assist with inactive analysis.  Test original weighted average formula vs exponential smoothing (learned in GT IAM), then test variations of each.  Realised that 
proper cross fold validation can be done, and that it will be better done in R !  Less error prone, possibly quicker and more re-usable!

6-June
14G updating, some training/troubleshooting with Angelo.
