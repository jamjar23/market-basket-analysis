Portfolio

NB02.py is a market basket analysis that was a problem in CSE6040 (Computation for Data Analytics) in my M.Sc. Analytics at Georiga Tech. While the basic construct was given to students, I was pleased with the concision of the code I developed within that construct. "groceries.csv" is provided as a source file, in case the original web source is unavailable.

IDTs is a heat map in Tableau that I constructed to identify problem origin-destination pairs, sized by volume and colored by transit times. (I'm a big fan of heat maps).

MS_Proj_VBA_txt is not really a "portfolio" item; it's just some code parked here for future reference. I preapred it to manipulate MS Project data so it could be better visualized in Tableau.
